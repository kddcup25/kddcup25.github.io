### With virtualenv

A few attachments under `2024_content/slides` are not included in this folder to meet the size limit requirement. When generating the website, they should be added back locally to the folder.

$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ make html
$ make serve        # Serve website locally. Point browser to: localhost:8000
